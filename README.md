# Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB)

## Overview

This repository contains code for quantum-assisted exploration of Parisi's replica symmetry breaking and topological collapse.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two primary directories:

### 1. SK_Model

The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model implementation contains the following subdirectories:

- **Benchmark**: Code for performance benchmarking (generates data and Figure 1)
- **Finite_size_scaling**: Finite-size scaling analysis (generates data and Figure 2)
- **Overlap_distribution**: Overlap distribution calculations (generates data and Figure 3)
- **Chaos_simulation**: Chaos dynamics simulations (generates data and Figure 4)

### 2. BC_Model

The BC model implementation contains code for generating data presented in Figure 5.

## Data Availability

The complete dataset generated by these simulations is approximately 5 GB in size. Due to size constraints, the data files are not included in this repository. Data files can be made available upon request.

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains Jupyter notebooks with the computational workflow for generating the corresponding figures and datasets referenced in the associated publication.
