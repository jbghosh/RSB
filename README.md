In this repository we perform a Quantum-assisted exploration of Parisi's replica symmetry breaking and topological collapse.

In the code repository there are two main folders:
1. SK_Model
2. BC_Model
In the SK model the relevant codes for generating the data and plots can be found in the
following folders.
1. 2. 3. 4. Benchmark (generates data and Fig.1)
Finite_size_scaling (generates data and Fig. 2)
Overlap_distribution (generates data and Fig. 3)
Chaos_simulation (generates data and Fig. 4)
In the BC_model folder the code can be found to generate the data for Fig. 5
All the generated data are about 5 GB in size therefore it is not included in the main
repository. If needed the data files also can be uploaded
